{"name":"Strictness","tagline":"Tracks declaration and assignment of globals in Lua","body":"strictness\r\n===========\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Yonaba/strictness.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Yonaba/strictness)\r\n\r\nIn Lua, one must use the `local` statement to create a local variable. On the other hand, global variables do not need assignment, Lua being [global by default](http://www.lua.org/pil/1.2.html). <br>\r\n\r\n*strictness* is yet another pure Lua module (compatible with Lua 5.1 and 5.2) which stands for tracking global variables declaration and assignments in your code.<br>\r\n\r\nWith *strictness*, one is forced to declare globals using a new function, `global`. As such, it helps having a better control on the scope of  variables and therefore minimizes the global environment namespace pollution.\r\n\r\n*strictness* is compatible with Lua [5.1](http://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1) and Lua [5.2](http://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.2).\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\n####Git\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/Yonaba/strictness\r\n\r\n####Download\r\n\r\n* See [releases](https://github.com/Yonaba/strictness/releases)\r\n\r\n####LuaRocks\r\n\r\n    luarocks install strictness\r\n    \r\n####MoonRocks\r\n\r\n    moonrocks install strictness\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n    luarocks install --server=http://rocks.moonscript.org/manifests/Yonaba strictness\r\n\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nPlace the file [strictness.lua](strictness.lua) in your project and call it with [require](http://pgl.yoyo.org/luai/i/require).\r\n\r\n    require \"strictness\"\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nSee [tutorial.md](docs/tutorial.md).\r\n\r\n##Tests\r\n\r\nThis project includes a custom test framework and specifications tests. To run these tests, run the following from the project root folder:\r\n\r\n    lua specs/tests.lua\r\n\r\n##Alternative implementations\r\n\r\nFeel free to check those alternate implementations, from with *strictness* takes some inspiration:\r\n\r\n* [strict.lua](http://rtfc.googlecode.com/svn-history/r2/trunk/lua-5.1/etc/strict.lua), which is included in the official Lua distribution\r\n* [pl.strict](https://github.com/stevedonovan/Penlight/blob/master/lua/pl/strict.lua), which is part of [S.
